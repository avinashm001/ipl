### This app performs webscraping of IPL Cricket player stats data (focussing on player rankings) and shows extensive explorative data analysis in real time.
I have uploaded all the datasets from 2008 to 2020 on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/adityarc19/ipl-player-stats-2008-to-2020).
### Python libraries: base64, pandas, streamlit, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn
